		tool lets you create and share feedback studies to gather detailed feedback from people
		about images, project pages, or interactive HTML prototype applications. </p>
<p class="p">To start, you create a new study, give it a name, and then add images or HTML prototypes to it.
			Then enter questions to be answered about each image, and create tasks for participants
			to complete on HTML prototypes. Then you publish the study to generate a study-link,
			which you  send to people that you want to provide feedback.</p>
<p class="p">When study participants click the study-link, the study opens in their browser. If they don't
			have a <span class="ph pname">SPLASH</span>
			account, the <span class="ph pname">SPLASH</span>
			landing page is displayed and you can sign up.When the study is displayed, participants
			have the option to keep their responses anonymous. As participants enter their
			responses, the project team members can view the feedback on the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Feedback</span> results page page almost immediately.</p>
