<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lato Font Software License</strong></p>
<p class="p">This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.</p>
<p class="p">This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:</p>
<p class="p">http://scripts.sil.org/OFL </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Preamble</strong></p>
<p class="p">The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
			development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
			efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
			open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
			with others.</p>
<p class="p">The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
			redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
			fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
			redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
			names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
			however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
			requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
			to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Definitions</strong></p>
<p class="p">"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
			Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
			include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
<p class="p">"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
			copyright statement(s).</p>
<p class="p">"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
			distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p class="p">"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
			or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
			Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
			new environment.</p>
<p class="p">"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
			writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Permission and Conditions</strong></p>
<p class="p">Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
			a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
			redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
			Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
				in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
			</li>
<li class="li">Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
				redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
				contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
				included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
				in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
				binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
			</li>
<li class="li">No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
				Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
				Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
				presented to the users.
			</li>
<li class="li">The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
				Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
				Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
				Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
				permission.
			</li>
<li class="li">The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
				must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
				distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
				remain under this license does not apply to any document created
				using the Font Software.
			</li>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Termination</strong></p>
<p class="p">This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
				not met.</p>

				import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
				those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
				infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
				Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
				If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
				Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
				patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
				License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
				filed.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Redistribution</strong><p class="p">You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

						wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
						NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
						License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
						Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
						text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
						cannot be construed as modifying the License. <p class="p">You may add Your own
							copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
							or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
							distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works
							as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
